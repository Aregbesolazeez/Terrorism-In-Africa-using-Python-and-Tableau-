# Terrorism-In-Africa-using-Python-and-Tableau
This project aims to use Python to conduct exploratory data analysis in order to create a clean and high-quality dataset focusing on terrorism in Africa by subregions (Northern Africa, Eastern Africa, Middle Africa, Southern Africa, and Western Africa), country, and city. The cleaned data are then used to generate insight using Tableau.
